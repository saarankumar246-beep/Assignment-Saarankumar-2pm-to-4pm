    <h1>My Morning Routine</h1>
    <p>I start my day with a cup of coffee and a few minutes of quiet reflection. It helps me focus and prepare for the day ahead.</p>

    <p>After that, I usually go for a short walk or do some stretches. Moving my body in the morning energizes me and clears my mind.</p>
