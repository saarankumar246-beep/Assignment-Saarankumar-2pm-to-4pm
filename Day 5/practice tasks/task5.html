        <h2>The Benefits of Drinking Water</h2>
        <p>
            Drinking enough water each day is essential for maintaining good health.
            It helps regulate body temperature, keeps joints lubricated, and delivers
            nutrients to cells. Staying hydrated can also improve energy levels and focus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Health experts often recommend drinking around 6–8 glasses of water daily,
            though individual needs can vary. Carrying a water bottle and taking small,
            frequent sips is an easy way to stay hydrated throughout the day.
